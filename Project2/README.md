# Project 2 - Date Program 

## Computer Engineering 260 (Data Structures and Algorithms) at San Diego State University

This program creates and displays a default date, showing the month, the day,
and the year, respectively, as 01-01-2000. After that, the program displays a menu
for the user to select between entering a new date, changing the current date, or
quitting the program. If the User wants to set a new date, the program calls the mutator
function "set" on the Date object with unsigned int parameters for the month, day, and year
Every time the menu is displayed, the current date is also displayed.
